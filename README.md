DonorSync

AI & Blockchain Powered Blood Donation Network

Built for Hackispiration Hackathon

⸻

Overview

DonorSync is an AI-enhanced and blockchain-secured blood donation management platform designed to create a transparent, intelligent, and reliable donor ecosystem.

Developed during the Hackispiration Hackathon, the project integrates Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concepts to improve trust, efficiency, and coordination in emergency blood donation systems.

⸻

Concept

Rather than working with a predefined problem statement, this project was built around the integration of AI and Blockchain technologies into a meaningful real-world application. The healthcare and blood donation domain was chosen due to its high social impact and urgent need for transparency and efficiency.

⸻

Blockchain Integration

DonorSync applies blockchain principles to:
	•	Secure donor records
	•	Prevent unauthorized data modification
	•	Maintain transparent donation history
	•	Build trust between donors and healthcare institutions
	•	Ensure immutable transaction logs

Each donation record is treated as a secure block, maintaining data integrity and traceability.

⸻

AI Integration

Artificial Intelligence enhances the platform by:
	•	Smart donor-recipient matching
	•	Location-based optimization
	•	Prioritizing urgent blood requests
	•	Predictive analysis of donor availability
	•	Data-driven decision support

AI improves response efficiency and reduces delays during emergencies.
